all()
Return True if all elements of the iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty).

zip()
Return 2 functions as Touples
>>> x = [1, 2, 3]
>>> y = [4, 5, 6]
>>> zipped = zip(x, y)
>>> zipped
[(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]
>>> x2, y2 = zip(*zipped)
>>> x == list(x2) and y == list(y2)
True

Smart use of those 2:
